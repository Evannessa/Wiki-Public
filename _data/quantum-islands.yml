      Our shared island [[Solis]] returns from the sea-town [[Amolai]]. Its gravity seems to cause the waterfalls to fall upwards, into the sky. 

      The island draws along with it undulating pools of floating water, shaped and suspended by strange forces. Sometimes they house reef-dwellers, sometimes slugs, and sometimes creatures of the deep.

      The false rain from the reversed falls and showering sky pools is a welcome refreshment, either way.
