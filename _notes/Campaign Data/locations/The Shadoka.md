# The Shadoka


A small [[Iothaenea|Iothaenean]] merchant's vessel whose lower hold was once filled with casks of spices, but now forms an artificial reef for marine life off the shore of [[Starshead Island]]. 

Irreparably damaged during [[The Storm]], it was salvaged for parts to build [[Starshead Village]].
