# Iothaenea


![[_site/assets/locations/Iothaenea.webp]]
Iothaenea exists on the twilight-dayside of [[Dovindi]], a planet tidally locked to its sun, where only a thin strip of the world is habitable.

After decades of open warfare, it is currently teetering in an uneasy ceasefire with [[Astrialum]].

## Social

While Iothaenea's social stratification is not as stark as those within Astrialum,

With blinding drought, scorching heat, sandstorms and dwindling supplies of water in the regions closest to the Sunside, many poorer Iothaeneans would rather try their luck in the cold, leaving Iothaenea and travelling across the Twilight Strand's Inner Sea to work in the frigid reaches of Nightside, unaware that things aren't much better in such dark and glacial climes.
