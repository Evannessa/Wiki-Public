# Starshead Island

![Starshead Island Image](/assets/locations/DarkHillsOcean.jpg)

## The Story

A ship, traveling to a new land, blown astray into uncharted by a rogue storm.

An island, unrecorded on any charts, bearing glittering shores and rolling green hills, food and water aplenty, while not the new world they'd set out to reach, a sanctuary and a paradise of its own.

Naming the island "Starshead", the surviving members of the Ruto clan and the Shadoka's Crew made the island their home, carving out a new life there.

But even paradise is not enough for some. Several of the sailors from the Shadoka, not content to settle down and remain on the safe outer shores, begin to delve deeper into the island's center, cutting through jungle and swamp, driven by the thrill of discovery.

Some return with stunning revelations, tales of strange ruins hidden in jungles or sunken in lakes. Some do not return at all.
But bit by bit, their discoveries are pieced together and make a few things clear to the stranded survivors.
