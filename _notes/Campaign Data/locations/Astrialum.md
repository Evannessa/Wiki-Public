# Astrialum

![[/assets/locations/Astrialum.jpg]]
Astrialum exists on the twilight-nightside of Solrise, a planet tidally locked to its sun, where only a thin strip of the world is habitable.

Astrialum rests on the side of the Twilight Strand of Solrise that faces away from the Sun, causing frozen waters and blistering cold.

After years of open warfare, it is currently teetering in an uneasy ceasefire with [[Iothaenea]], though political and nationalistic violence toward Iothaenean immigrants has not stopped in the midst of this cold war.

## Social

The wealthiest of Astrialum's people live on the equitorial coastal regions of the Sundown Sea, far enough into the Twilight Strand's center that the weather is temperate and the dark of night not omnipresent, the skies lit by dusklight and strands of aurora.

But the poorer live out into the Nightside, not on land but upon the thick ice of the Cryo-Sea, where overcrowded and hastily-built cities are built around outposts mining deep into the ice, driven by powerful engines providing enough heat to melt water and keep the cold at bay, but fill the skies with choking smog that blocks out the crystalline glimmer of the stars.

This is the homeland of [[The Ruto Clan]], though many Iothaenean immigrants married into the family as well.
