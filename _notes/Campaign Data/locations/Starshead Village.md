# Starshead Village

![Starshead](/assets/locations/Starshead.webp)

Starshead is a village located on the temperate river coast, where the vegetation is lush. Starshead grew around a calm, coastal bay, and is comprised predominantly of humans. They are an egalitarian feudalist democratic anarchy that worships many deities, none having a clear majority at all.

The nearest landmark is an extremely deep and narrow slot canyon. Itâ€™s easy to jump over, but if you fell in it would mean certain death. A population of 2813, the denizens live a modest existence. A civic festival is currently taking place.

### Government in Starshead

The people of Starshead work the land in exchange for working their lord's lands. None take responsibility for the stewardship of Starshead, but the people hold the best semblance of order, the head of whom is Ms Arava Ebynichtomonis.

#### Economics

Trade in Starshead is regulated, with taxes and restrictions on what can be brought in and out of the village, and people live a modest existence because of it. The trade guild enforces rules, with stiff penalties and trade bans for rule-breakers. Welfare is above average. Citizens can expect a decent education, provided they can pay for it. Healthcare is overtaxed and underfunded.

#### Law and Order

The policing presence in Starshead is more of a militia; some of the members of The Regiment of Unbreakable Hand are part time, and there is little need for the use of force outside of intruders. Law in Starshead is reform-based, and those that breach the laws can expect incarceration, fines, or going to an asylum for reform. The death penalty is reserved only for traitors to the state. Magic is typically reserved for those with a license. There is some magic, but is mostly for personal use, and sometimes commercial.
