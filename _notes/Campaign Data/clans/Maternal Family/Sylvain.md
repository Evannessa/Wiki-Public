# Sylvain

## Traits

Traits: Inexpressive, Cautious, Reserved, Clever, Laconic, Calm, Patient

## Bio

Growing up, Sylvain's family knew him as a quiet, careful patient man. Which is why it startled them all when after only months after Starshead Village was founded, Slyvain up and disappeared into the wilds of the Ebon-Rain Forest.

In his makeshift home, they found a letter, where he revealed that he had been in a secret relationship with a crew-member aboard [[The Shadoka]]

The two had fallen in love, and planned to marry once they reached the new world. But the woman, known as Sola, had been lost in [[The Storm]].

Anyone who can brave a journey through the mist-filled foliage of the Ebon-Rain Forest, and find the secluded area known as Sola's Spring, will find Sylvain's Hut there, where day in and day out the man toils, attempting to break through to the [[Other World]], where he is convinced he will reunite with Sola.
