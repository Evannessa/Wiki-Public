# Taza

#wip

Traits: Passionate, Determined, Courageous, Brash, Outspoken, Protective, Stubborn, Righteous, Impatient

## Bio

Taza is likely the second-biggest source of conflict among the Ruto Clan besides Aunt [[Angelica]]. Within her burns a fire, and when convinced she is right, she will not back down.

This has lead to her getting into trouble, with some of the more judgmental Ruto clan members (such as [[Angelica]] and [[Mateo]]) insisting her trouble-making behavior is the real reason they had to leave the homeland, but others applauding her courage and determination to always stand up for what is right.

## History

Engaged to [[MC]] back in [[Astrialum]], Taza was an immigrant from [[Iothaena]], a nation with which [[Astrialum]] was engaged in a cold war after decades of open warfare paused and teetering on the brink of an uneasy ceasefire.

[[Iothaenean]] immigrants in [[Astrialum]] were often targets of nationalistic violence, and many, like [[Nomalanga]], learned to keep their heads down as much as possible as a result.

Taza, however, refused.

### The Attack

One evening while waiting outside a grocery for her fiancé [[MC]] to pick up the last ingredients for the family's dinner, she was passed by a group of drunken Homeland soldiers, who hurled insults and slurs, and upon hurling insults right back, was struck in the face by a thrown bottle of beer which shattered, cut her face, drenched her clothes.

Injured and indignant, she opened a cannister of offal and blood that she'd gotten earlier from the butcher's shop, and threw it upon her attackers.

This escalation likely could have ended much worse, had [[MC]] and the grocer inside not seen the enraged group advancing upon Taza from inside.

Taught how to handle fights by their father [[Genki]], [[MC]] rushed outside to defend their fiancée, and only upon realizing the soldiers had weapons, threw a scalding pot of stew into the face of the ringleader, before grabbing Taza and fleeing.

This incident was the final straw that spurred the [[Ruto Clan]] into leaving [[Astrialum]] for good.
