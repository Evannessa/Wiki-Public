# Taza

#wip

Traits: Passionate, Determined, Courageous, Brash, Outspoken, Protective, Stubborn, Righteous, Impatient

## Bio

Taza is likely the second-biggest source of conflict among the Ruto Clan besides Aunt [[Angelica]]. Within her burns a fire, and when convinced she is right, she will not back down.

This has lead to her getting into trouble, with some of the more judgmental Ruto clan members (such as [[Angelica]] and [[Mateo]]) insisting her trouble-making behavior is the real reason they had to leave the homeland, but others applauding her courage and determination to always stand up for what is right.

## History

Engaged to [[MC]] back in [[Astrialum]], Taza was an immigrant from [[Iothaenea]], a nation with which [[Astrialum]] was engaged in a cold war after decades of open warfare paused and teetering on the brink of an uneasy ceasefire.

[[Iothaenean]] immigrants in [[Astrialum]] were often targets of nationalistic violence, and many, like [[Nomalanga]], learned to keep their heads down as much as possible as a result.

Taza, however, refused.
