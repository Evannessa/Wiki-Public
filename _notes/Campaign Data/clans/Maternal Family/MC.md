# MC

Traits: Loyal, kind, warm, honorable, guilt-ridden

While originally named after their grandmother, MC was a name they chose for themselves. MC is the oldest of the grandchildren, conceived when their parents [[Nomalanga]] and [[Genki]] were still teenagers.

They are statuesque, tall and lean with muscle, a birthmark along their neck, shoulders and back.

Warm and trusting, they tend to laugh when they talk, and value loyalty and family beyond all else. Along with their father [[Genki]] and their aunt [[Ester]], they use their strength to do most of the hunting and manual labor in the village.

The younger members of the Ruto Clan find cousin MC's home always a welcome safe place.

### History

See [[The Attack]] for more information.

While an overcrowded home and political tensions heating up by the minute had placed the option to leave the homeland on the table, an incident MC endured was the catalyst for their family's attempt to move to the new world.

This is a fact that brings them no end of guilt, especially since the storm claimed the life of their beloved [[Grandma|Grandmother]], though no one in the family blames them.

## Current Day

Having finally begun to find peace on the island, and let go of the guilt that bound them, now MC finds themselves haunted by the strange effect Starshead Island seems to be having on their children, the only two to be born here.

First [[Petra]] claimed she could hear Great-Grandma's voice, calling her toward the Lost Lake.

Now little [[Lourenco]] claims he knows how to find those who were lost in [[The Storm]] that brought them here.

He has mapped out the island through vivid dreams. And based on the explorations of [[Sylvain]], [[Taza]] into the wilds... the child's drams are accurate.
