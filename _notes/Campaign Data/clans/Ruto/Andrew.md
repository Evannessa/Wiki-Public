# Andrew

## Traits

Charming, wisecracking, weak-willed, gossip, great cook

## Overview

Uncle Andrew is charming and clever, but weak-willed. A successful businessman back in the homeland, and the only one with his own place, the family was surprised by his sudden desire to skip town and leave his fortune behind for unknown waters, but now they realize he likely he got tangled up mismanaging his money for luxuries before being saddled with debts owned to the wrong people.

Even after years on Starshead Island, he still wears his finest clothes, despite the fact that they are tattered and worn-out.

He has a jolly demeanor and tells engaging stories, a trait he inherited from his mother [[Grandma|Rosa]] but tends to get easily distracted by his thoughts, trailing off mid-sentence.

His siblings are aware that back home he had a reputation as a bit of a slime-ball, and was too fond of food and drink far beyond his budget. But his time on Starshead has humbled him, and for the kids of the Ruto Clan, spending time at his home was by far the most fun.
