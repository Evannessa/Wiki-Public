## Bio

Aunt Angelica's emotions have always been a tad unstable, and back in the homeland, were a constant source of conflict in the family. Her moods were as mercurial as the island weather, and a sunny smile could become a stormy disposition at the drop of a hat.

This was in stark contrast to Sylvain, her twin brother, who often seemed, on the other end of things, almost *emotionless*. 

However, it's become clear to the family that her emotional ravings were like the pent frustrations of a caged bird. The freedom of the open sea upon [[The Shadoka]], and the wonder of the deep wilds that carpet this mysterious island, have untethered her. Her joy is one more warm and stable. 

While Angelica is still the main source of arguments and drama, she is also so often the light of everyone's life, able to brighten even the grayest days with a radiant smile or witty joke.

She also knows *everyone's* secrets.
