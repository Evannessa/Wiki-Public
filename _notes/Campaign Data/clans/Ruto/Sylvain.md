## Bio

Growing up, Sylvain's family knew him as a quiet, careful patient man. Which is why it startled them all when after only months after Starshead Village was founded, Slyvain up and disappeared into the wilds of the Ebon-Rain Forest.

In his home, they'd found a letter, where he revealed to them that he'd been in a romantic relationship with a crew-member aboard The Shadoka. That he thought he'd fallen in love with her, even.

He'd planned to tell his family once they'd arrived in [[Iothaenea]].

But the woman, known as Sola, had been lost in The Storm.

And Sylvain's further hesitation had been compounded by his father's outburst toward the Shadoka's crew. 

As Sola had been one of the so-called 'cultists', who Grayson blamed for Rosa's death. And Sylvain had known.

Ashamed and conflicted, Sylvain forced himself into a self-imposed exile, hoping following in his mother's adventurous footsteps, and discovering more about the island's mysteries, could help find *something* to ease his father's pain, to help his family come to term with things, and to clear Sola's name.

Rather than joining the remaining crew-members in [[SunRune Outpost]], Sylvain built his own home in the depths, near a spring he named after the woman he loved.

No amount of persuading his twin sister [[Ester]] or [[Grandpa|Grayson]] could bring him back home. He was determined to find answers and make amends first. 

Anyone who can brave a journey through the mist-filled foliage of the Ebon-Rain Forest, and find the secluded area known as Sola's Spring, will find Sylvain's Hut there. 

If he isn't home, it's likely he's within [[Lost Lake]] or deeper into the [[Ebon-Rain Forest]], where day in and day out the man toils, attempting to break through the [[Mirrored Moon]] to  the [[Other World]], where he is now convinced he will both find his mother and reunite with Sola.

While at home, though, he is happy to see his family whenever they visit his secluded home, though the only few willing to make the trek are his twin sister [[Ester]] and his adventurous grand-niece [[Petra]], who is often accompanied by her parent [[MC]].
