## Bio

Rosa Ruto was the matriarch of the Ruto Clan. She was a mesmerizing figure, moving and speaking in a hypnotic way where people would hang on her every word, and she could persuade a man to give him the ring off of their his finger (it's said this is how she hooked her husband, [[Grandpa|Grayson]] ).

She could weave the most mundane tale into an edge-of-your-seat adventure, and while her wild stories of her youthful escapades might have been exaggerations for the sake of drama, everyone in her family repeats them as if truth.

Well-loved by her children and grandchildren, her loss during [[The Storm]] was crushing to her entire family, especially [[Grandpa|Grayson]].

But if [[Petra]]'s visions and [[Lourenco]]'s dreams are anything to believe... perhaps she is not as gone as once believed.
