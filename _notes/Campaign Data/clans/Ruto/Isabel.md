# Isabel

## Traits

<span class='traits chip-list'>Down-to-earth, mature, level-headed, unadventurous, homebody, joy-kill</span>

## Bio

Isabel is mature and down-to-earth, always looking out for her other family members, especially her uncle [[Andrew]], older brother [[Luca]] and her younger cousins [[Petra]] and [[Lourenco]].

While easy to talk to and come to with problems, Isabel can be quick to throw ice-cold water on any flames of passion or enthusiasm, having inherited or picked up some of her father's danger-averse disposition, though expressing it as practicality rather than paranoia.

It's simply safer, of course, to stay in Solrise Hills or on Solrise Strand, to not 'rock the boat' and make any dangerous treks into the wilds.

For this reason, though young cousin [[Petra]] enjoys [[Isabel]]'s company, she tends to avoid sharing much about her planned adventures.
