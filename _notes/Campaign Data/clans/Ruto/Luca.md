# Luca

<span class='traits chip-list'>Trusting, Na√Øve, A dreamer, Creative, Friendly, Melodious Voice, Animated, Cheerful, Rebellious</span>

## Bio

At first impression, Luca seems the odd-one-out of his immediate family. Bearing neither his mother [[Ester]]'s quiet contemplation, his younger sister [[Isabel]]'s down-to-earth perspective, nor his father [[Mateo]]'s overabundance of caution, Luca is optimistic, social, and quick to make friends.

Despite this sunny disposition, Luca often spent his childhood hovered over by his father [[Mateo]], who often refused to let his son wander very far from home after Luca was partially paralyzed during [[The Storm]].

Luca grew up feeling trapped and agitated at his father's overprotective nature, and in early adolescence, Luca spent more and more time away from home, crashing at the homes of his Aunt [[Angelica]] or Uncle [[Andrew]], whose more animated personalities he gelled with much better.

And after several arguments, at the age of seventeen, he even seemed to follow in his Uncle [[Sylvain]]'s footsteps, not only leaving home, but leaving [[Starshead Village]] entirely.

Though rather than moving into the wilds to live on his own, [[Luca]] moved in with the Shadoka crew in [[SunRune Outpost]] (much to his [[Grandpa|grandfather's]] dismay).
