## Traits

<span class='traits chip-list'>motivated, adventurous, curious, enjoys outdoing others, determined</span>

## Bio

Petra was the first child born on Starshead Island, with her mother [[Taza]] carrying her in the midst of the [[The Storm]].

She spent her childhood playing with domesticated island animals and following her older cousins [[Luca]] and [[Isabel]] around, pretending she was a wild adventurer like her late [[Grandma|late Great-Grandmother]] she heard so much about.

But around seven years later, when [[Petra]]'s younger brother [[Lourenco]] was born, [[Petra]] began to have strange visions.

Sometimes, while playing among the hills or within the outskirts of the forest, she'd feel dizzy, as if struck by sudden vertigo, her ears would ring, and her vision would blur.

And once it cleared, she'd see herself standing in a completely different realm, with everything strangely mirrored and reversed, as if upside-down.

Noting down her observations, and sharing them with her favorite uncle [[Sylvain]] when she visited him in his hut in the **Ebon-Rain Forest**, the two began to piece more things together.

The "other realm" she'd see was often the same depending on which region of the island she found herself in.

While in [[Solrise Hills]], closest to her home village, she'd see a strange burning land of seething fire and choking smoke, with red airless skies and flows of magma, glowing rock, and toxic plumes.

In [[The Ebon-Rain Forest]], she'd see a strange, airless expanse of floating rock and stellar gasses, and a sky bright-lit with the raining glow of falling stars.

While running along the white beaches and shallow tides of [[Solrise Strand]], she'd see beautiful pastures and rolling green hills more lush than [[those they called home]].

And while within the wetland reaches of the [[Lost Lake]], she'd see the same lake, but the landscape towering around it, which seemed to hint at holding the previous three mirrored regions she noted, was flipped.

When [[Sylvain]] sketched all of this down, and compiled it all together with his own observations over the years, he came to a conclusion.

[[Starshead Island]] existed on two separate dimensions, or planes
