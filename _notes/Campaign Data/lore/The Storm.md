# The Storm

## Back to Iothaenea

After [[The Attack]], The Ruto Clan chose to flee both their city and their country, in order to protect [[MC]] from the cruel and unfair reprecussions they would undoubtedly face.

Aided by some contacts of [[Taza]], the family managed to be stowed away upon a small trading vessel known as [[the Shadoka]], hidden among the cargo.

Though the circumstances that had spurred them leaving were horrible, [[Grandpa|Grayson]] was amazed to see the light and life return to his wife [[Grandma|Rosa]].

Though all of their children were now grown, she expressed such joy at the fact that they finally got to fulfill their wish to travel with their family, even if only for a journey escaping across the Solrise Sea to [[Iothaenea]].
